Git and GitHub are powerful tools for version control and collaboration. This manual provides an overview of essential commands and practices. For more detailed information, consult the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/).

Running a website using GitHub is usually done through GitHub Pages, a service that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### 1. Create a Repository
1. **Log in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in with your credentials.
2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
   - Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-website`).
   - Choose "Public" if you want others to see it, or "Private" if you prefer restricted access.
   - Optionally, add a description and initialize it with a README file.

### 2. Prepare Your Website Files
1. **Create your website files**: You should have at least an `index.html` file. You can also include CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.
2. **Organize your files**: Put them in a single folder or structure them as needed.

### 3. Upload Your Files to GitHub
1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub.
2. **Upload your files**:
   - Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files."
   - Drag and drop your website files or choose them manually.
   - Commit the changes.

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages
1. **Go to repository settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.
   - Scroll down to the "Pages" section (it’s usually under the "Code and automation" section).
2. **Choose the source for GitHub Pages**:
   - Under "Source," select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Select the root directory if your files are in the root of the repository. If they are in a folder like `/docs`, choose that folder.
3. **Save**: Click "Save" to apply these settings.

### 5. Access Your Website
1. **Get the URL**: GitHub will provide a URL where your site is published. It usually looks like `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
2. **Visit the URL**: Open your browser and navigate to the URL to see your website live!

### Additional Tips
- **Custom Domain**: You can set up a custom domain if you have one. Instructions for this are available in the GitHub Pages documentation.
- **Jekyll**: GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, a static site generator. If you're using Jekyll, you can include a `_config.yml` file in your repository.
- **Updates**: To update your website, simply push new changes to the repository. GitHub Pages will automatically update your site.
